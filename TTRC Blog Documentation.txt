TTRC Feedback Center

Feedback Center

Initial Idea is to create a blog environment where users can 
submit a topic for discussion and have feedback

The general categories will be:

Trading Journal 

New Ideas for the Site 

Enhancements to existing functionality

Initially this will be written in Node.js and Mondgodb 

Probably will be collapsed into the .Net Core area not certain as of now
